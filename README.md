# lein-jit has been replaced!

This plugin is deprecated. The released version mysteriously stopped working,
and the name was misleading.

The replacement is **[lein-otf](https://github.com/timmc/lein-otf)**.
OTF = On The Fly, a better name for Clojure's default compilation model than
"JIT", which is correct but ambiguous (the same name is used for the JVM's
conversion of portable bytecode into machine code.)
